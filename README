Program files:
Tmain.c
Tmain2.c
huff_tree.c
Header:
huff_tree.h

Scripting file: session

To compile, type in make
And to compress, type in ./huff inputfile outputfile, where input file is the file to be compressed and outputfile is the compressed code.
To decompress, type int ./puff outputfile puffedfile, where outputfile is the file from compressor and puffed file is the decoded text
Then type in make clean (if you want to clear compiled files)

I have a few examples of inputs and outputs in the folder for testing purposes,
and I made a script illustrating some of them: in the assignment guide it's
stated that we should have a script illustrate all of the app functions, which I
think doesn't make sense and must be from last assignment, so I just scripted
for a few examples.

I did the extra credit part of using a binary min heap.

Known bugs and deficiencies:
My code does not handle the leftover bits very well and sometimes there are
more characters at the end, but Geoff indicated that this is ok.
